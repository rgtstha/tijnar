I am a 21 years old guy, passionate about Computer, Science and Technology. I love to stay updated with the latest technology as much as possible. Currently I am working on learning mobile application development with Flutter and I am enjoying with it. I always believe in learning and sharing. Therefore I have a Youtube Channel Ranjit Tech Nepal where I upload technical videos for sharing my knowledge.
